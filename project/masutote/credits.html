<p>Hello and Welcome!</p>

<p>This website is based off projects by <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandredes"> alexandredes </a> and his websites <a href="http://hiragana.training/">hiragana.training</a> &amp; <a href="http://katakana.training/">katakana.training</a> both of which were extremely interesting in concept! I loved the idea of these websites but couldn't find a version for turning the ます form of words into て form. As of which I gutted the original websites down to the most basic level of code that I could get (keeping his app intact) and made this website in order to aid my learning.</p>

<p>You can find alexandredes's social links here</p>

<p>P.S If you are the alexandredes and you aren't happy with me hosting this resource i'd be happy to take it down. I've got no ad's on here as to not claim revenue on work that is not completely my own! Hopefully your fine with me hosting this.  </p>
