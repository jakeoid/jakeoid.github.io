        Pokemon Picross, a game released on the 3DS contains many puzzles in
        which you must much the number of pixels to a row. Of course this can
        tend to be challenging and when you get stuck it can be painful. This
        resources attempts to aid and relief those many challenging levels by
        having a near complete list of levels.

        <h2>Text to Image Generator.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-description">
        The Text to Image Generator is a resource that was created to serve a
        very specific purpose, that being the ability to convert a set of text
        (in a table) to an image for a later resource on Jakeoid. As I worked
        on it people around me grew interested and as a result it was published
        with the little to no documentation. This has henceforth been fixed and
        now serves as a great function for quick uses.

        <h2>Converting Romaji to Hiragana.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-description">
        This is an extremely old resource, basically its transfers from Romaji
        into Hiragana. For what I used it for back in the day (which really
        wasn't much) it worked perfectly fine. Being written in April of 2015,
        it doesn't share the same level of modern application that i'd once
        would've liked so i've chosen to put it up here for the sake of having
        it up. It has been straight marked as to Legacy as again, if it broke I
        wouldn't care for to update it.

    <h2>Old Man Pokémon Glitch.</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-description">
    Way back in the day when Pokemon Red &amp; Blue were first released, a
    glitch was discovered that allowed for people to spawn in the mysterious
    MissingNo. But then again, each player received a different plethora of
    Pokemon when they surfed along this shore, why was this? This was due to
    the player's username and is reliant on the fact that you don't share the
    same name.

    <div class="col-description">
        If you've ever needed to learn how to tell the difference or even learn
        to convert on the go the ます forme of a word to the て forme this is the
        best way to do that. Coded by myself with a great helping hand from
        alexandredes. I've made the quickest way to get to begin practicing
        between converting ます forme to て forme when your out on the go, with
        mobile support!

        Based off Nintendo<sup>(TM)</sup> and there different consoles that they have release, 
        this shows the correlation between what Cartridge will work dependent 
        on what device that you are using. This goes the whole way from 
        Gameboy (DMG) all the way up to the New 3DS. This was the first 
        resource uploaded to Jakeoid and as a result isn't very good.
