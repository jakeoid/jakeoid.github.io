                        <br />Pokemon Picross, a game released on the 3DS contains many puzzles in which you must much the number of pixels to a row. Of course this can tend to be challenging and when you get stuck it can be painful. This resources attempts to aid and relief those many challenging levels by having a near complete list of levels.

                        <br />The Text to Image Generator is a resource that was created to serve a very specific purpose, that being the ability to convert a set of text (in a table) to an image for a later resource on Jakeoid. As I worked on it people around me grew interested and as a result it was published with the little to no documentation. This has henceforth been fixed and now serves as a great function for quick uses.

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <br />This is an extremely old resource, basically its transfers from Romaji into Hiragana. For what I used it for back in the day (which really wasn't much) it worked perfectly fine. Being written in April of 2015, it doesn't share the same level of modern application that i'd once would've liked so i've chosen to put it up here for the sake of having it up. It has been straight marked as to Legacy as again, if it broke I wouldn't care for to update it.

                        <br />Way back in the day when Pokemon Red &amp; Blue were first released, a glitch was discovered that allowed for people to spawn in the mysterious MissingNo. But then again, each player received a different plethora of Pokemon when they surfed along this shore, why was this? This was due to the player's username and is reliant on the fact that you don't share the same name.

                        <br />If you've ever needed to learn how to tell the difference or even learn to convert on the go the ます forme of a word to the て forme this is the best way to do that. Coded by myself with a great helping hand from alexandredes. I've made the quickest way to get to begin practicing between converting ます forme to て forme when your out on the go, with mobile support!

                        <br />Based off Nintendo and there different consoles that they have release, this shows the correlation between what Cartridge will work dependent on what device that you are using. This goes the whole way from Gameboy (DMG) all the way up to the New 3DS. This was the first resource uploaded to Jakeoid and as a result isn't very good.
