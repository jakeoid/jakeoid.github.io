<p>Hello and Welcome!</p>

<p>This website is based off projects by <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandredes"> alexandredes </a> and his websites <a href="http://hiragana.training/">hiragana.training</a> &amp; <a href="http://katakana.training/">katakana.training</a> both of which were extremely interesting in concept! I loved the idea of these websites but couldn't find a version for turning the ます form of words into て form. As of which I gutted the original websites down to the most basic level of code that I could get (keeping his app intact) and made this website in order to aid my learning.</p>

<p>You can find alexandredes's social links.. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandredes">Twitter</a> <a href="https://github.com/alexandredes">Github</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alexandredes">Reddit</a><br \></p>
